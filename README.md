# Callidus

possible options:

-h | --hypertree followed by the file name containing the hypertree

-y | --yannakaki followed by 's' or 'p' for a sequential or parallel execution. (s as default)

-i for activate the in-memory computation for the sub_CSP

-s | --solver followed by AbsCon or Nacre to choose the solver to use. Nacre as default.

-d | --debug if you want to see the output of the translation, decomposition and sub_CSP computation

-sc followed by 's' or 'p' to for a sequential or parallel execution of sub_CSP computation. (p as default)

-b | --balanced followed by 'det' or 'balDet' to choose the algorithm of BalancedGo

-printSol followed by yes or no for the final print of solutions

-computeWidth followed by yes or no for do the width computation apart from the decomposition

-output followed by the file name if you want to write the solution on a file. N.B. the structure is will be different
